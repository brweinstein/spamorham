# Human vs Model Experiment

## Methodology

Participants were asked to fill out a Google Form given these instructions:

You will be shown a series of messages (emails or SMS). For each message:

A. Read the message carefully.
B. Use the slider (1–10) to indicate how confident you are that the message is spam:
1 = You are EXTREMELY confident the message is legitimate (Ham)
10 = You are EXTREMELY confident the message is spam (Illegitimate)
C. Take your time, there are no right or wrong answers, but answer honestly based on your intuition.

Then participants read 25 messages and ranked them on a scale from 1 to 10 based on how confident they are that the messages are illegitimate. In other words, ranking a message a 10 means they are VERY confident that the message is a scam. 

## Data

See the subset used in the human test in `data/human_test_set.csv`. The data in this sample test set was randomly chosen to remove personal bias from the selection.
